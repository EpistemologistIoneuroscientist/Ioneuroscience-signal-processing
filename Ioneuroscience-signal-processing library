Python library for advanced neurological signal processing and analysis (EEG, fMRI, neural spike data)
The Ioneuro Signal Processing Library provides a robust and efficient suite of tools for researchers, clinicians, and developers working with neurological data. Designed to handle various modalities including Electroencephalography (EEG), Magnetoencephalography (MEG), functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), and raw neural spike data, this library offers cutting-edge algorithms for data acquisition, filtering, feature extraction, spectral analysis, and more. It aims to streamline the workflow from raw data to insightful findings, accelerating research and development in neuroscience, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), and neuro-diagnostics.
